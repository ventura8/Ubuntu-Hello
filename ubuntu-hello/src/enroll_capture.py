# Guided multi-sample face capture used by `ubuntu-hello add`.
#
# A model used to be one 128-d descriptor from the first frame that showed a
# face: one pose, one expression, one IR exposure. Authentication is a nearest
# neighbour distance to a stored descriptor, so that single snapshot often
# landed just past the certainty threshold when the head or the light moved
# a little. Windows Hello enrolls from many frames while guiding the user
# through small head movements; this module does the same. All the camera /
# dlib work is passed in as callables so the sequencing is unit-testable.
